# Python-Challenge

## Introduction
___
    Python is one of the most common languages used by programmers and engineers across a variety of fields. The popularity in usage is due to the logical syntax that allows ease of code readability, also helped alone by the implemented usage of significant indentation. It is also looked favorably upon by most due to its comprehensive library and list of modules.
___
## Objective
___
    The objective of this challenge/assignment was to have the students use python in real-world examples to give them an idea of how to utilize python in situations outside of just class and assignments. A resource file was assigned to each part of the assignment which was to serve as a resource for the Python scripts to utilize in order to fulfill the objectives.
    
    The overreaching goal to achieve with each assignment was to use python to:
        * open and then parse/read data inisde files(i.e csv, text) using modules to open said files
        
        * manipulate the real-world data to extrapolate answers from
        
        * output the resulting extrapolated data into a separate file and/or the terminal

    The task was to create a Python script that pulls and analyzes the records of a [bank's monthly budget] (https://github.com/abhikenobi/Python-Challenge/blob/main/Py-Bank/Resources/budget_data.csv "Budget Data") to calculate each of the following:

        * The total number of months included in the dataset

        * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

        * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those 
          changes

        * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

        * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
    
    After calculations the Python script then had to be able to print the results into a newly created text file (.txt) in the Analysis folrder and also the terminal as shown below:
